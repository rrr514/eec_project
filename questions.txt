-When is Scheduler.init() called?
	-As far as I can tell, this is the only place to create new machines
	-As such, is it called whenever the .md file has a machine class?
		-These can be placed through the file though, so is it called continuously or does the cloud bunch these machine classes together?
	-Spec says it is called after simulator reads entirety of input, so it looks like after all machine classes
		-How does init know how many machines to establish?
-Need to keep track of:
	-Memory Usage
		-Overcommitting tasks to a machine with not enough memory will slow down performance immensly
	-CPU Usage
	-CPU States
		-Powering down takes less time than powering up
		-Going from S5 to S0 may take whole minutes (extremely slow)
