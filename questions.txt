-When is Scheduler.init() called?
	-As far as I can tell, this is the only place to create new machines
	-As such, is it called whenever the .md file has a machine class?
		-These can be placed through the file though, so is it called continuously or does the cloud bunch these machine classes together?
	-Spec says it is called after simulator reads entirety of input, so it looks like after all machine classes
		-How does init know how many machines to establish?
-Need to keep track of:
	-Memory Usage
		-Overcommitting tasks to a machine with not enough memory will slow down performance immensly
	-CPU Usage
	-CPU States
		-Powering down takes less time than powering up
		-Going from S5 to S0 may take whole minutes (extremely slow)

E-Eco:
Split machines up by CPU type - Each one should then be split into 3: Active, Standby, and Off
-For ratio, split evenly (1/2 standby, 1/2 off - since none will be active at first)
	-However, when active becomes 1/2 of standby, convert 1 off machine into standby
		-On NewTask
	-And then, when active is 1/3 of standby, convert 1 standby machine into off
		-On TaskComplete
-SLAVioation: Do nothing
-Memory Warning: Do nothing? (Worry about later)
